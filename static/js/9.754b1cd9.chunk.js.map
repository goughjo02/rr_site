We\n\t\t\t\tbelieve that education is the key to making lasting change in\n\t\t\t\tdisadvantaged communities. It’s the way to change social\n\t\t\t\tattitudes, enable children to grow into well-equipped adults,\n\t\t\t\tand foster a growing economy.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<img src={SmilesSchool} alt=\"smiles in school\" />\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tNumerous studies have shown that children who are sponsored are\n\t\t\t\tmore likely to stay in school. They are more likely to find a\n\t\t\t\tjob in the future and even become positive leaders in their\n\t\t\t\tcommunities. Importantly, girls who remain in education are far\n\t\t\t\tless likely to get married at a young age, become pregnant at a\n\t\t\t\tyoung age, or even turn to unsavory vocations as a means of\n\t\t\t\tsurvival.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<img src={TwoInSchool} alt=\"two in school\" />\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tRise Rwanda began with the sponsorship of just three children\n\t\t\t\tand is now supporting education for over 20. Sponsorship\n\t\t\t\tincludes; 2 meals per school day, health insurance, school\n\t\t\t\tbooks, school uniforms, PE gear and transport to school.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<img src={YellowRoad} alt=\"yellow road\" />\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tYou can contribute to this sponsorship though this link. You can\n\t\t\t\tchoose a nominal donation amount or yearly sponsorship. Yearly\n\t\t\t\tsponsorship is just €330 and if you sign up you will receive\n\t\t\t\tdetails of the child you’re sponsoring and their story so far.\n\t\t\t\tYou will also receive regular updates and three school reports\n\t\t\t\teach year on how the child is getting on in school.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<img src={YellowThankYou} alt=\"yellow thank you\" />\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tEven better you could contribute by attending one of Rise\n\t\t\t\tRwanda’s #givingbackthroughyoga classes. These donation based\n\t\t\t\tyoga classes have snowballed in popularity and they offer mutual\n\t\t\t\tbenefits for all involved.
