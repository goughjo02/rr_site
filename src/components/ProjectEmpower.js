			<h3>Introduction:</h3>

				Project Empower is a new objective for Rise Rwanda. Its aim is
				to foster sustainability through a Microfinance project. Based
				on organisational experience of finance and economics within
				Rise Rwanda, along with familiarity with the local community, we
				are now in a strong position to utilize tried-and-tested methods
				of investment and business planning to stimulate growth of a
				local proliferating economy in Rwamagana. Candidates of this
				programme are all mothers or guardians of children currently
				involved with Rise Rwanda.

			<div>
				By setting these females up as entrepreneurs we are establishing
				them as role models in the community, increasing the household
				income, reducing dependency on charity and improving prospects
				for the children. Microfinance is shown to be among the most
				effective means of poverty alleviation. By providing economic
				opportunity and support, it presents impoverished people with
				the chance to become self-sufficient. In the context of our
				project, financing business ventures for mothers and guardians
				of school children has many positive effects – it improves the
				quality of life, it improves the ability to educate children,
				and most importantly it places these women at the heart of the
				economy and presents them as role models for their children. In
				total, we view this as the most effective way to break the cycle
				of poverty.
			</div>
			<h3>The story so far</h3>
			<div>
				This project has been in planning for over three years. In that
				time we have identified a group of thirty women to form our
				first micro finance group. These women have all developed
				personalised business plans, tailored to their strengths and
				interest, and which have been examined for feasibility by
				trained experts. We have validated these business plans in the
				context of the local environment and put in place training for
				these women. This training will introduce these women to savings
				and benefits of planning opportunities that can come from
				regularly saving. The training components are intended to
				increase effectiveness of credit lines, increase productivity
				and ultimately increase income for the entrepreneurs. This
				training will also be helpful overcoming a variety of
				non-financial barriers that they may encounter. Training
				consists of SME business administration, basic accountancy, and
				marketing. Although training may be ongoing it is generally only
				given once before the entrepreneur receives their first loan.

			<h3>The Model:</h3>
			<div>
				We are adopting a model of group lending. Group-lending projects
				experience much higher repayment rates than commercial lending
				institutions due to peer-monitoring and support. As a group, our
				candidate entrepreneurs meet on a regular basis where they
				receive mentoring and support. These meetings involve a local
				Rwandan who is educated in economics and finance and who is
				providing expert advice. This individual also manages planning
				and reporting of the project and business ventures from the
				ground. A number of meeting have taken place with the candidates
				and they are very excited about the potential for this project.
			</div>
			<h3>Aim:</h3>
			<div>
				We want to EMPOWER the women entrepreneurs of Rwanda and help
				them to be in a position to provide for their families. We
				predict that this work will have a positive impact on the local
				community by increasing commerce and creating local employment.
				We want to assist these women to realise their entrepreneurial
				dreams, to be in a strong position to provide for their
				families, and to become stronger ROLE MODELS for their children
				and their community!

			<h3>
				Microfinance can help break the cycle of poverty in a number of
				ways:
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Providing micro entrepreneurs with the capital needed to
					start their businesses, and giving them access to a reliable
					source of credit allows them to better plan their business
					activities and manage their cash flow. Although the size of
					the loans may seem small (sometimes just €150), it is worth
					remembering that for half of the world’s population who
					survive on less than €2 a day; this is still a significant
					sum.
				</li>
				<li>
					The increased income generated by businesses, and the
					ability to save and obtain loans, allows disadvantaged
					people an opportunity to build their assets, for example by
					acquiring land, constructing or improving their homes and
					purchasing livestock and poultry.
				</li>
				<li>
					Secure and accessible savings facilities provide a means for
					poor people to reduce the vulnerability of uncertain and
					irregular incomes, by allowing them to better manage risk
					and cash flow. Entrepreneurs receive training on how to save
					and the benefits of saving; a portion of each week’s
					repayment will go into savings. Access to credit, savings
					and insurance helps to smooth cash flows and avoid periods
					when access to food, clothing, shelter, or education is
					lost. Microfinance can make it easier to manage shocks such
					as sickness to the family breadwinner or theft. Savings are
					also used to accumulate money that can be used for
					investment or to meet the costs associated with expected
					commitments such as their children’s education and weddings
					or unexpected events such as ill health and funerals.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Invest in a Business:</h3>
			<div>
				We have received seed funding from The RTE One World Fund and
				The UDG Healthcare CSR Fund. This will allow us to begin funding
				business ventures for 13 entrepreneurs but there are many more
				potential entrepreneurs hoping to obtain capital for their
				business plans. If you are looking to make a seriously impactful
				difference in the lives of many, choose this donation option .
				Based on the prerequisite that recipients of financial support
				are prepared to generate a positive return on the investment. It
				is expected that loans will be repaid over time, entrepreneurs
				will become self-sufficient, and funds will become available to
				repeat the process again. In theory the donation could be
				recycled indefinitely.
